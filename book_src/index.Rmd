# Preface {-}

This book contains documented R examples to accompany several chapters of the popular data mining textbook
[_Introduction to Data Mining_](https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~kumar001/dmbook/)
by Pang-Ning Tan, Michael Steinbach, Anuj Karpatne and Vipin Kumar.

The code can be used with either edition: 1st edition [@Tan2005] or 2nd edition [@Tan2018].

The code examples collected in this book were developed for the course [CS 7331 - Data Mining](http://michael.hahsler.net/SMU/EMIS7331) 
taught at [SMU](http://www.smu.edu) since Spring 2013 and will be regularly updated and improved. 
The latest update includes the use of the popular packages in the meta-package `tidyverse` [@R-tidyverse] including `ggplot2` [@R-ggplot2] for data wrangling and visualization along with
`caret` [@R-caret] for model building.
