The code examples collected in this book were developed for the course [CS 7331 - Data Mining](http://michael.hahsler.net/SMU/EMIS7331) 
taught at [SMU](http://www.smu.edu) since Spring 2013 and will be regularly updated and improved. 
The latest update includes the use of `tidyverse` and `ggplot2` throughput.
